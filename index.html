        <h2>Jewelry Making as a Hobby</h2>

        <p>
            Making jewelry is very fun. You can use many different kinds of materials!
            <br> <br>
            For instance, my personal favorite materials to use are beads, elastic bands, and string.
            You can make friendship bracelets with string and elastic bands, and beads can be used to make necklaces,
            keychains, earrings, and so much more! Select one of the tabs above to learn more about
            each material, see some examples, or even watch a tutorial.
