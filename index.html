            <p>Making Jewelry is so fun!</p>
            <p>It's a hobby that you can do anywhere, almost any time. Pretty accessible too: you only need some string to get started!</p>
            <p>I make jewelry out of three main mediums: beads, string, and elastic bands. I've been making friendship
                bracelets out of string for a long time, and started when I was 8 years old at summer camp.
                For elastics, I use a rainbow loom. I also used that when I was younger, but I recently started
                back up again. Lastly, I use beads! This is the most versatile one in my opinion. You can make
                earrings, necklaces, bracelets, anklets, rings, whatever you can think of! My favorite thing to do with 
                them is to look up a bead animal pattern on pinterest and then recreate it with wire and seed beads
                so I can hang them on earrings.
