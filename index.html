            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>Making Jewelry is so fun!</p>
            <p>It's a hobby that you can do anywhere, almost any time. Pretty accessible too: you only need some string to get started!</p>
            <p>I make jewelry out of three main mediums: beads, string, and elastic bands. I've been making friendship
                bracelets out of string for a long time, and started when I was 8 years old at summer camp.
                For elastics, I use a rainbow loom. I also used that when I was younger, but I recently started
                back up again. Lastly, I use beads! This is the most versatile one in my opinion. You can make
                earrings, necklaces, bracelets, anklets, rings, whatever you can think of! My favorite thing to do with 
                them is to look up a bead animal pattern on pinterest and then recreate it with wire and seed beads
                so I can hang them on earrings.
            </p>
            <p>To the top right, there are some basic examples. I will go into more detail in the 
                sections below!

            <h3>String - Bracelets/Anklets</h3>

            <p>
                Making bracelets and anklets out of string has long been a part of my artistic expression. 
                When I was at camp we would make them for each other, attatching them to our water bottles.
                That is essentially how I still make them today!
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, however, I can make more complicated patterns than I used to. My current favorites
                to make are the chevron, diamond, and vertical wave patterns. If I want to relax and zone 
                out while making a bracelet, I'll typically do the simpler candy stripe.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is a linked video tutorial for a candy stripe bracelet!

            <h3>Beads</h3>

            <p>Beads are currently my favorite medium to use! They are also the most versatile medium to use 
                (in my opinion). The very first thing I learned to make out of beads was a flower patterned necklace,
                and it is still one of my favorite things to make. It is, however, a lot more time consuming than
                making a bracelet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Something that ISN'T as time consuming - but just as fun - is using tiny glass seed beads to make
                bead animals! If you follow a pattern on pinterest, they're the PERFECT size to attach to earrings
                or a keychain.
            </p>

                Here are some of my favorite bead animal patterns!
